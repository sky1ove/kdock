AZAQUIN AZOLINE PAN-KRas INHIBITORS

FIELD OF THE INVENTION

"[00001] The present invention relates to compounds that inhibit multiple mutated forms of KRas, i.e., pan-KRas inhibitors. In particular, the present invention relates to pan-KRas compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds and methods of use therefor."

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

"[00002] Kirsten Rat Sarcoma 2 Viral Oncogene Homolog (“KRas”) is a small GTPase and a member of the Ras family of oncogenes. KRas serves as a molecular switch cycling between inactive (GDP-bound) and active (GTP-bound) states to transduce upstream cellular signals received from multiple tyrosine kinases to downstream effectors to regulate a wide variety' of processes, including cellular proliferation (e.g., see Alamgeer et al., (2013) Current Opin Pharmcol. 13:394-401)."

"[00003] The role of activated KRas in malignancy was observed over thirty years ago (e.g., see Santos et al., (1984) Science 223:661-664). Aberrant expression of KRas accounts for up to 20% of all cancers and oncogenic KRas mutations that stabilize GTP binding and lead to constitutive activation of KRas. KRas mutations at codons 12, 13, 61 and other positions of the KRas primary amino acid sequence are present in 88% of all pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients, 50% of all colon/rectal adenocarcinoma patients, and 32% lung adenocarcinoma patients (e.g., see Prior et all., (2020) Cancer Res 80:2969-74). A recent publication also suggested wild type Kras inhibition could be a viable therapeutic strategy to treat KRasWT dependent cancers (e.g., see Bery et al., (2020) Nat. Commun. 11 : 3233)."

"[00004] The well-known role of KRas in malignancy and the discovery of these frequent mutations in KRas in various tumor types made KRas a highly attractive target of the pharmaceutical industry for cancer therapy. Notwithstanding thirty years of large-scale discovery efforts to develop inhibitors of KRas for treating cancer, no KRas inhibitor has yet demonstrated sufficient safety and/or efficacy to obtain regulatory approval (e.g., see McCormick (2015) Clin Cancer Res. 21 (8):1797-1801 )."

"[00005] Compounds that inhibit KRas activity are still highly desirable and under investigation, including those that disrupt effectors such as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (e.g., see Sun et al., (2012) Agnew Chem Int Ed Engl. 51 (25):6140-6143 doi: 10.1002/anie201201358) as well recent advances in the covalent targeting of an allosteric pocket of KRas G12C (e.g., see Ostrem et al., (2013) Nature 503:548-551 and Fell et al., (2018) ACS Med. Chem. Lett. 9:1230-1234). Clearly there remains a continued interest and effort to develop inhibitors of KRas, particularly inhibitors of activating KRas mutants-."

"[00006] Thus, there is a need to develop new pan-KRas inhibitors that demonstrate sufficient efficacy for treating KRas-mediated cancers."

"[000047] Also provided herein is the use of a compound of Formula (1), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, as defined herein, in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a KRas wild type associated disease or disorder or a KRas G12A, G12C, G12D, G12R, G12S, G12V, G13D and/or Q61H-associated disease or disorder."

"[000048] Also provided herein is a method for treating cancer in a patient in need thereof, the method comprising (a) determining that the cancer is associated with KRas wild type or a KRas G12A, G12C, G12D, G12R, G12S, G12V, G13D and/or Q61H mutation (i.e., a KRas G12A, G12C, G12D, G12R, G12S, G12V, G13D and/or Q61H-associated cancer); and (b) administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or a pharmaceutical composition thereof."

"[000049] One potential utility of the herein-described pan-KRas inhibitors, including pan-KRas inhibitors such as (R)-1-(7-(8-ethyl-7-fluoro-3-hydroxynaphthalen-1-yl)-8-fluoro-2-(((2R,7aS)-2-fluorohexahydro-.1H-pyrrolizin-7a-yl)methoxy)pyrido[4,3-d]pyrimidin-4-yl)-3-"

"methylpiperidin-3-ol (Example 5 herein), is for the treatment of cancers that develop resistance following long-term treatment with KRas G12C inhibitors. Thus, embodiments of the invention include those wherein a patient suffering from cancer is treated with a herein-described pan-KRas inhibitor such as Example 5 after treatment with a G12C inhibitor becomes ineffective or less effective due to the emergence of resistance-imparting mutations."

[000050] Treatment of KRas G12C mutant cancers with covalent KRas G12C inhibitors such as adagrasib (MRTX849) or sotorasib (AMG510) may result in the incorporation of additional mutations that confer resistance to adagrasib. These mutations could confer resistance through numerous mechanisms.

"[000051 ] Mutations that change the mutant cysteine at codon 12 to another amino acid would render the current covalent KRas G12C inhibitors ineffective since current inhibitors make a covalent bond with the mutant cysteine amino acid side chain. Likewise, in patients that have one wild type KRas allele in addition to the KRas G12C-mutant allele, mutations in the wild type codon 12 glycine to another codon would allow bypass signaling in these tumors through the novel mutant protein. The repertoire of codon 12 mutations that can occur with a single nucleotide substitution in the wild type gene (glycine codon) includes mutations commonly observed in cancer such as G12S, G12V, G12R, G12C. The repertoire of codon 12 mutations that can occur with single nucleotide base substitutions of the cysteine codon 12 include mutations not frequently observed in cancer, G12Y, G12F and G12W, in addition to G12S and G12R."

"[000052] Second-site mutations may also occur in another location in the KRas G 12C mutant gene that confers resistance to KRas G12C inhibitor treatment. These mutations may confer resistance through different mechanisms. RAS proteins are small GTPases that normally cycle between an active, GTP-bound state and an inactive, GDP-bound state. RAS proteins are loaded with GTP through guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs; e.g., SOS1) which are activated by upstream receptor tyrosine kinases, triggering subsequent interaction with effector proteins that activate RAS-dependent signaling. RAS proteins hydrolyze GTP to GDP through their intrinsic GTPase activity which is dramatically enhanced by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Mutations at codons 12 and 13 in RAS proteins impair GAP-stimulated GTP hydrolysis leaving RAS predominantly in the GTP-bound, active state. Covalent KRas G12C inhibitors in current clinical development only bind GDP-bound KRas G12C. Mutations such as Q61 codon mutations, which"

"may or may not occur on the same allele as the G 12C mutation, reduce the intrinsic GTPase activity of KRas and may represent a mechanism of resistance to KRas G12C inhibitor treatment by shifting KRas into the GTP-loaded state where it is not susceptible to covalent inhibition. Comutations such as R68, H95 and Y96 may be present along with the KRas G12C mutation and may diminish the binding affinity of KRas G12C inhibitors to the Switch II binding pocket."

[.000053] The herein-described pan-KRas inhibitors may demonstrate activity against common as well as uncommon codon 12 mutations or mutations that occur in the KRas protein that diminish binding of KRas G12C inhibitors to the KRas protein.

"[000054] Also provided herein is a process for preparing a compound of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof."

"[000055] Also provided herein is a compound of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof obtained by a process of preparing the compound as defined herein."
