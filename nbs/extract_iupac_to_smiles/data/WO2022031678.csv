The mixture was stirred at 40 °C for 2 hours. After completion, the reaction mixture was filtered. The filtrate was purified by prep-HPLC (column: Shim-pack C18 150*25*10 pm; mobile phase: [water (0.225% FA)- ACN]; B%: 11%-31%, 10 min) and lyophilized affording the title compound (46.7 mg, 38% yield, 1.3 FA).

The mixture was heated to 40 °C and stirred for 12 hours under N2. Upon completion, the mixture was filtered and the filtrate was concentrated in vacuum to give a residue. The residue was purified by reversed phase flash chromatography (0.1% FA condition) affording the title compound (80 mg, 65% yield). Yellow solid. [ESI, M+l]: 657.3."
